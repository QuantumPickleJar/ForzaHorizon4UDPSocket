The data out format in Forza Motorsport 7 contains a wide variety of parameters. Some of those may or may not be very informative at any given point in time. To facilitate logging only the data you want, the `data2file.py` utility can read in a configuration file that specifies the parameters you're interested in.

This document describes how to write that configuration file, and gives a list of all the data that can be logged. I've also created an example configuration file with a short list of parameters in `example_configuration.yaml`.

The configuration file needs to be written in a language called YAML. It is not a very complicated language, and the configuration file is a text file, meaning it can be edited with common text editors like Notepad on Windows and TextEdit on Mac OS.

In the case of `data2file.py`, the configuration file will consist of either lines looking like `key: value` that specify an option and it's value, or the list of parameters. We will cover the latter in more detail below.

## Configuration options
The configuration file can override all the command line options. They are as follows:

* `port`: The port number of listen on. Needs to be a number, typically larger than 1024.
  * Example: `port: 1123`
* `output_filename`: The name of the file to write the logged data to.
  * Example: `output_filename: forza_data.tsv`
* `format`: The format of the output file, one of either `tsv` (tab-separated values) or `csv` (comma-separated values).
  * Example: `format: tsv`
* `append`: Whether the data should be appended to the output file, or if the file should be created/overwritten. The value should be either `True` or `False`, respectively.
  * Example: `append: False`
* `packet_format`: The format of the data packets. Either `sled`, the older format, or `dash`, the newer format.
  * Example: `packet_format: dash`

The example configuration file sets all of these options and can be used as a starting point for creating your own configuration file.

## List of parameters
Perhaps the most useful part of the configuration file is the possibility of specifying what data should be logged. By default, everything is logged, and it's a fairly large amount of data. That's not very useful if only a few of the things really interests you.

In the configuration file the parameter list is its own option, so the first line of it has to start with `parameter_list:`. Below that you will write each parameter you want logged on a separate line, indenting it with a few spaces followed by a dash and another space before the parameter's name. Here's an example:

```yaml
parameter_list:
  - lap_no
  - cur_lap_time
  - cur_race_time
```

This configuration logs only the current lap number, the current lap time, and the current race time.

Here are all the potential parameters that can be defined. For some of them, we've supplied an explanation of what they are.
